Research Phase of MyEwu Portal

Jackie Churchill:

What needs to change in order for you to use MyEWU Portal?

There would need to be easier access to Canvas, Eaglenet and mail.  The site would need to be easier to use and have the ability for the student to customize settings.  

What additional features would you like to see added to MyEWU Portal?

There needs to be more visual cues on website.  For example there needs to be icons on buttons.  The ability to use just one login to access all information.  The ability to set home page to custom settings i.e. if the user uses canvas and eaglenet frequently the user should be able to make those featured on the page for easy access.  Consolidated navigation bars that have clear tabs i.e. canvas, email, eaglenet. 

Stacking order:

1. Easy access to Canvas, eaglenet, and mail.
2. Visual pictures and functional icons.
3. One login.
4. Customization of preferred pages.
5. Clarity in usage/ customization.
